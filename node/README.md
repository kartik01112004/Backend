# NODE jS

## Global object

eg: window object of browser
`node global`

we dont need to call global ..we can use its fn without calling it

we use reqire to import an object or a class from another file

we use `modules.exports` for exporting a file to another file

### buffer

a package of data that is sent when we log a file use `.toString()` to make that buffer data readable

## Stream & Buffer

### Stream

Start using data before its fully loaded
eg: watching video on yt -- we dont need to download full video we can start watching as soon as we get some data.

### Buffer

small chunks of data sent in a stream is called buffer

## Client & Server

on client request server sends responce
how does client know what to send to which server.

### IP Address & Domain names

## Creating a server

Localhost is like a domain name and it takes us to a loop back ip adderess that is 127.0.0.1 which makes our computer act as a host

Port numbers are like 'doors' into a computer
localhost:3000
