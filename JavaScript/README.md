## JS

`typeof` can be used to get type of that variable

null is an object type

## Asyncronys javascript

In simple terms it takes a bigger task and convert it into small ones

### Differnece b/w Syncronus and Asyncronous

Syncronous systems do tasks one by one like following a recipie we cannot do next step without perfroming previous one.
Where as Asyncronous systems can do multiple taskes at a time (multithreading).

### Callback

Calling a function in a function is a caled callback.

### callback hell

callback hell is callbacks in callbacks...
solution is promises...

### promise cycle

when we use .then() repeatedly for getting our work done

### Async Await

this is a better way of writing promises
we mke use of async functions and where we wanna wait for something to get done we use await

this doesn't mean that all the processes stop it just pause the async function but all other functions or processes continues to work with no hinderence
